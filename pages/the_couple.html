									<h3>Khusboo</h3>
									<p><span class="image left" style="width: 268px; height: 500px;"><img src="../images/khusboo_1.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
										I would describe myself as someone who is honest, caring, intelligent, hardworking, and ambitious. I have a great sense of humour. I am an easy going person & don’t get easily disturbed by down’s in my life. I a spiritual person & have a good library of best spiritual books. I also enjoy travelling, watching movies, going out for dinner, and having great intellectual conversations!

									<h3>Anil</h3>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="../images/bhaskar_1.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
										Anil was born in Mysore, he spent most of his summer holidays at his grandparents home in Kuvempunagar, in the sandalwood city. Always with an army of friends who used to come for tuitions taught by his mother and her sisters, everyone sprouted wings when a little devil stepped off the auto rickshaw. Now they all could get away with anything. Anil's mom screaming his name in the morning because of his latest mischief, was an everyday alarm and broadcast to the locality that they lived in. This in an age where social media hadn't taken over our lives, soon prompted by his name being yelled by his friends on the front door. Anil was never short of love from his nearest and dearest or getting whooped for causing trouble on a daily basis. Carrying a screwdriver in his pocket at all times, he was the family's in-house all round technician and put more things together than breaking them, while secretly learning how to build computers. His love for music, machines and technology is deep rooted (in that order), which explains spending all summer afternoons in front of a Nintendo console, large headphones and prescription spectacles. Ankita still wishes everyday that the PS5 in the entertainment center never existed. If you found him outside the house, he probably was running with a football at his feet. Half jock, half nerd, he has cultivated these interests well into his adult life, that make him who he is today.
									</p>
									<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="../images/bhaskar_2.jpeg" alt="" /></span></div>
									<p>
										Anil loves animals too, Jess has converted him from a mostly dog to a mostly cat person. Anil had a knack for extra curricular activities, traveling with Ankita for inter school competitions and winning events in his own category. He was the president of the art club and won several football competitions, even while in Colorado, USA (he likes to flex about his undefeated intramural championship victory medals triumphing two years in a row). Anil's heart, mind and soul are intertwined with nature and mountains, 3 years in Colorado were the best years of his life as a bachelor. This is when photography became his new found hobby. However, his engineering years were where he made his best friends and a lot of core memories. They are and always will be the most important people in his life apart from his family. Anil vows a lifetime IT guarantee to Ankita, that he will be readily available 24/7 to troubleshoot... anything and everything technical.

									<h2>Alright ...  Here's the Story</h2>

										In 2016, the two were both wild and running free around Boston's Seaport and Financial District as most singles do. Yes, we were just good friends back in Bengaluru. Although some people argue that Ankita was the only friend to send Anil off at the airport or Anil had a semi surprise plan (thanks Vijetha for putting Anil on speaker while planning a secret arrival !) to receive her at the Logan airport and help her settle in Boston. Let's clear the air, there were no sparks. The chemistry first started on a night walk along the  Charles river espionage to see the Boston skyline. First sparks flew during a trip to Anil's relative's house on a commuter rail. Ankita still holds her best friends - Vijetha and Alister accountable for inducing these sparks and feeding the thought of <b>“Why not?”</b> in her head.

										2017 and 2018 were the years of adventure, travel and of course long distance. Living thrifty during the semester and spending most of their on-campus earnings on flight tickets and car rentals, they road tripped the wild wild west every break. Ankita missed the European and Russian adventure during the Football World Cup in 2018 but Anil promised not to visit her favorite destinations. The rest is history - they've shared some amazing adventures visiting 30 states in the United states, and now they're ready to share the rest of their lives together, too.

										Soon Anil found a job in Robotics in Pittsburgh, moving slightly closer to Ankita. After a day of experiencing the New York City skyline from the clouds in a helicopter and shopping in Times Square, he popped the question in Queens, with the midtown Manhattan skyscrapers in the backdrop, on a chilly fall evening. No way Ankita could say no, as Anil knows her tolerance to cold; she wouldn't risk walking back alone in that weather ! November 30, 2019 will forever be etched in their memories.
									</p>
									<blockquote>
										Care was taken to plan events at least 15 days apart from other anniversaries or birthdays of the Bride and Groom. Ankita highly disapproves of combining celebrations and letting one life event steal the thunder of another.
